# How to run - automatic makefile
- Set PULL_SECRET environment variable to your pull secret
- `make start-iso` - Spins up a VM with the the liveCD. This will automatically perform the following actions:
	- Extract the openshift installer from the release image
	- Generate the install-config.yaml 
	- Execute the openshift-installer `create single-node-ignition-config` command to generate the bootstrap-in-place-for-live-iso.ign.
	- Download the RHCOS live ISO
	- Embed the bootstrap-in-place Ignition to the ISO.
	- Create a libvirt network & VM
	- Boot the VM with that ISO
- You can now monitor the progress using `make ssh` and `journalctl -f -u bootkube.service` or `kubectl --kubeconfig ./sno-workdir/auth/kubeconfig get clusterversion`

# How to run - manual mode
- Create a workdir for the installer - `mkdir sno-workdir`
- Create an `install-config.yaml` in the sno-workdir. An example file can be found in `./install-config.yaml.template`
- Download the ISO to the workdir `./download_live_iso.sh sno-workdir/base.iso`
- Get an installer binary using `oc adm extract` or `./hack/build.sh`
- Generate an ignition file using the installer with `./generate.sh`. Invocation example:
```bash
INSTALLATION_DISK=/dev/sda \
RELEASE_IMAGE=registry.svc.ci.openshift.org/sno-dev/openshift-bip:0.2.0 \
INSTALLER_BIN=./bin/openshift-installer \
INSTALLER_WORKDIR=./sno-workdir \
./generate.sh
```
- Embed the ignition file inside the ISO using `./embed.sh`. Invocation example:
```bash
ISO_PATH=./sno-workdir/base.iso \
IGNITION_PATH=./sno-workdir/bootstrap-in-place-for-live-iso.ign \
OUTPUT_PATH=./sno-workdir/embedded.iso \
./embed.sh
```

You can now use `sno-workdir/embedded.iso` to install a single node cluster. The kubeconfig file can be found in `./sno-workdir/auth/kubeconfig`

# Other notes

* Default release image is registry.svc.ci.openshift.org/sno-dev/openshift-bip:0.2.0, you can override it using RELEASE_IMAGE env var.
* make will execute the openshift-installer with OPENSHIFT_INSTALL_EXPERIMENTAL_BOOTSTRAP_IN_PLACE_COREOS_INSTALLER_ARGS=/dev/vda
* if youâ€™re running the installation on a BM environment, it should be updated.
